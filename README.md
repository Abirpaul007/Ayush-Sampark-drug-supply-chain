## 🚀 Key Features

- **Blockchain Integration:** Secure, immutable tracking of drug orders and deliveries using Ethereum smart contracts.
- **Role-Based Dashboards:** Custom dashboards for Admin, Vendor/Manufacturer, Hospital, and Pharmacy users.
- **Order & Inventory Management:** Place, track, and manage drug orders and inventory at every supply chain node.
- **Smart Contract Automation:** Automated contract execution for order fulfillment and delivery confirmation.
- **Document Management:** Upload and verify invoices, proofs of delivery, and other documents (Cloudinary/IPFS support).
- **Real-Time Tracking:** Live order and shipment status, including dispatch, delivery, and expiry logs.
- **Analytics & Reporting:** Visual dashboards with KPIs, performance metrics, and compliance monitoring.
- **Authentication & Authorization:** Secure login with NextAuth, role-based access, and session management.
- **Modern UI:** Built with Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, and FontAwesome for a responsive, user-friendly experience.
